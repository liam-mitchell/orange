CHARACTERS

Four characters to start:
	- Rogue
	- Mage
	- Cleric
	- Fighter

Each character needs:
	- Basic abilities (3 or 4?...)
	- Models
	  - Textures
	  - Particles (???)
	- Animations
	  - Attacks
	  - Abilities (are these going to be separate from attacks?...)
	  - Movement
	- Stats (more below)
	- Basic gear?...
	  - Probably no models for gear
	- Some backstory?...

Stats:
	- Keep it simple: strength, agility, intelligence (for now!)
	- Strength:
	  - HP
	  - Melee damage
	- Agility
	  - Armor/evasion (???)
	  - Ranged damage
	- Intelligence
	  - Mana
	  - Magic damage

	- OR damage based on hero type (so dota! but it is good...)

Basic abilities (general):
	- Movement cooldowns for EVERYONE! =)
