Modifiers and buffs need to:
	- Buff any and all stats
	- Deal damage over time
	- Heal damage over time
	- Slow move speed
	- Stun
	- Block damage

Stat buffs:
	- Reference to the stats
	- Just change them on start, track how much you changed them, change back on end

Damage over time:
	- Just send 'on_damage()' every so often - easy

Slow:
	- Same as stat buff - movespeed is a stat!

Stun:
	- Send interrupt_all(high priority) every frame

Absorb damage:
	- Send on_damage(-damage) every time it's recieved
	- At end, deal damage all around = how much has been taken

Storage and updating:
	- Store buffs and modifiers in a separate list
	- Buffs for complex effects, modifiers for simple stat buffs
	- Apply modifiers in order every turn to the base stats (keep copy of base)
	- Update buffs every turn, call start and end at start and end
