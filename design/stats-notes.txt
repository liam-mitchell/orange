Three core stats:
	- Strength
	  - HP - 10 points of HP per point of strength
	  - HP regen - 1 point / second / 10 points of strength
	- Agility
	  - Attack speed - 1 point of attack speed per point of agility
	  - Armor - 1 point of armor per 5 agility
	    - Would this be more sensible as 1 / 1 and percentage reduction?... like attack speed
	- Intelligence
	  - Mana - 10 points of mana per point of intelligence
	  - Mana regen - 1 point / second / 10 points of intelligence

Attack stats:
	- Attack damage
	  - From primary attribute - 1 point / point of attribute
	  - Base damage
	  - Attack damage should probably average out to about 10 - 12 damage per attack for players
	  - Enemy attack damage should be around 5 - 6 probably?
	  - How much healing is there going to be?
	- Armor
	  - Damage reduction - damage * (10 / (10 + armor)) = final damage
	- Attack speed
	  - Percent increase - base attack time * (100 / 100 + attack speed) = attack time

HP and mana:
	- HP - 10 pts of HP / pt of strength = probably 200 hp on average?...
	  - This seems low... maybe 20? but maybe not
	  - HP regen - rate above may be too quick
	- Mana - similar amounts of mana?
	  - This might need more balancing... but it will work for now
	  - Same problem as HP for regen
